    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <blockquote><big>Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Toronto’s stylish Yorkville locale, <strong>‘Homely Café’</strong> 's development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.

        <br><br> In contrast to other Indian eateries, <strong>‘Homely Café’</strong> was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.
        
        <br><br>We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.
        
       <br><br> Our menu highlights things that utilize the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forget the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.</big></blockquote>
