    <strong>What is charset?</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>From ASCII to UTF-8.</li>
        <li>ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used
            on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ <>.
        </li>
        <li>ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character
            codes.</li>
        <li>HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.</li>
        <li>ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that
            ANSI has 32 extra characters. <br>The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8
            character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!</li>
        <dl>
            <dt>Difference between charset & encoding?</dt>
            Basically: <dd>Charset is the set of characters you can use</dd>
            <dd>Encoding is the way these characters are stored into memory</dd>
        </dl>
    </ul>
