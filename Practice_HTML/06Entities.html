        Entity- An entity is a piece of text/string that begins with an ampersand(&) and end with a semicolon(:)

        If you want to display <>-Angular braces, if you directly use <>, then it will not  show in browser.
        That's why we use Entities.
            e.g. &lt;AngularBracket&gt;

        Entities are used to display reserved characters or invisible charaters which would be otherwise interpreted in HTML code.
