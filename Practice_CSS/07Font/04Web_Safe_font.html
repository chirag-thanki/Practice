    <h3>What are Web Safe Fonts? 
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Web safe fonts are fonts that are pre-installed by many operating systems. While not all systems have the same fonts installed, you can use a web safe font stack to choose several fonts that look similar, and are installed on the various systems that you want to support. 
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;If you want to use fonts other than ones pre-installed, as of CSS3, you can use Web Fonts.</h3>

        <p class="web-safe-fonts">Fonts which are pre-installed on (most of) system are called web-safe fonts. <br>This is a web-safe font.</p>
        <p class="web-fonts">Fonts which are imported from web on system are called web fonts. <br> This is a web font.</p>
